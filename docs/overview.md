# DistributedLLM: High-Level Architecture Overview

## Introduction

DistributedLLM is a framework that enables running large language models across multiple machines with heterogeneous hardware configurations. It's designed to address the challenges of running resource-intensive LLM inference when no single machine has enough computational power or memory to efficiently run the entire model.

The system implements a "Boss-Workers" (also known as Master-Slave) distributed computing model where a coordinator node orchestrates multiple worker nodes to collaboratively perform inference tasks.

## Core Concepts

### Heterogeneous Computing

The framework is designed to work with a mix of different hardware:
- High-end servers with multiple GPUs
- Desktop computers with consumer GPUs
- Laptops with integrated graphics
- Machines running different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)

This heterogeneity is embraced rather than seen as a limitation, with the system dynamically adapting based on the capabilities of each node.

### Model Sharding

Large models are split across multiple devices using model sharding techniques:
- **Automatic sharding**: System analyzes available resources and distributes model components optimally
- **Layer distribution**: Transformer layers can be split across multiple GPUs
- **Component separation**: Model components (embeddings, transformer blocks, output heads) can be assigned to different machines
- **Memory-CPU tradeoffs**: Parts of the model can be offloaded to CPU when GPU memory is limited

### Dynamic Load Balancing

The system continuously monitors performance and adjusts workload distribution:
- Faster machines get assigned more computation tasks
- Performance history influences future task assignments
- Workers can join or leave the cluster dynamically
- The system adapts to changing conditions (like other applications competing for resources)

## System Architecture

The distributed system consists of three main components:

### 1. Coordinator Node

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the distributed computation across all workers.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Maintains registry of available worker nodes
- Splits computation into tasks
- Assigns tasks to workers based on their capabilities
- Monitors worker performance
- Aggregates results from workers
- Handles worker failures and task reassignment
- Provides a unified interface for clients to submit inference requests

### 2. Worker Nodes

**Purpose**: Execute assigned computation tasks and report results back to the coordinator.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Report hardware capabilities to coordinator
- Receive and execute assigned tasks
- Monitor local resource utilization
- Process model components and run inference locally
- Return results to coordinator
- Handle task failures gracefully

### 3. Client Interface

**Purpose**: Provides a simple interface for applications to use the distributed system.

**Key Features**:
- Similar API to popular ML frameworks
- Abstracts away the complexity of distributed inference
- Handles tokenization, generation parameters, and result processing

## Workflow

### System Initialization

1. The coordinator starts and begins listening for worker connections
2. Worker nodes start and connect to the coordinator
3. Each worker reports its hardware capabilities and available resources
4. Coordinator builds a registry of available computing resources
5. Model weights are distributed to workers based on their capabilities

### Inference Process

1. Client submits a prompt for inference
2. Coordinator tokenizes the input and plans the computation
3. For an autoregressive model (like GPT or LLaMA):
   - Input processing tasks are distributed to available workers
   - Initial token generation tasks are assigned
   - As tokens are generated, new tasks are created for the next token
   - Workers pull new tasks when they complete previous ones
4. Results are aggregated by the coordinator and returned to the client

### Dynamic Adaptation

Throughout the inference process:
1. Performance metrics are collected from each worker
2. The scheduler adjusts task assignments based on observed performance
3. If a worker becomes unavailable, its tasks are reassigned
4. If a new worker joins, it's incorporated into the task distribution

## Key Components

### Coordinator Components

- **Scheduler**: Distributes tasks to workers based on their capabilities
- **Performance Monitor**: Tracks worker performance for load balancing
- **Result Aggregator**: Combines outputs from distributed model components

### Worker Components

- **Compute Engine**: Executes assigned tasks using local hardware
- **Resource Monitor**: Tracks system resource usage and availability
- **Communication Client**: Handles network communication with coordinator

### Model Components

- **Model Layers**: Implementations of model architecture components
- **Tokenizer**: Converts text to tokens and vice versa
- **Inference Engine**: Handles the inference process logic

## Performance Considerations

### Communication Overhead

- Task granularity is balanced to minimize communication overhead
- Large tensors are serialized efficiently
- Results are cached to avoid redundant computation

### Memory Management

- The KV cache is distributed across workers
- Memory is managed carefully to avoid OOM errors
- Unused model components can be offloaded to save memory

### Fault Tolerance

- The system handles worker disconnections gracefully
- Tasks from failed workers are reassigned
- Results are cached to minimize lost work

## Setup and Deployment

The system includes setup scripts for all major platforms:
1. **Coordinator Setup**: Run on the machine that will coordinate tasks
2. **Worker Setup**: Run on each machine that will participate in the computation
3. **Configuration**: Edit YAML files to adjust settings for your environment
4. **Launch**: Start the coordinator, then start workers on each machine

## Usage Example

```python
from distributed_llm import DistributedClient

# Connect to the coordinator
client = DistributedClient(coordinator_address="192.168.1.100:5555")

# Generate text
response = client.generate(
    prompt="Explain quantum computing in simple terms",
    max_new_tokens=500,
    temperature=0.7
)

print(response)
```

## Benchmarking and Optimization

The `benchmark.py` script helps optimize the configuration for your specific hardware mix:
1. Test different sharding strategies
2. Measure throughput under different loads
3. Find the optimal batch size
4. Determine the best worker configuration

## Conclusion

DistributedLLM enables running large language models on hardware that would otherwise be insufficient, by combining the computing power of multiple machines. The Boss-Workers model with dynamic load balancing ensures efficient resource utilization, while the model sharding approach allows flexibility in how model components are distributed.

The result is a system that can run state-of-the-art language models like LLaMA, GPT, or T5 across a network of consumer-grade hardware with performance approaching that of specialized high-end servers.
