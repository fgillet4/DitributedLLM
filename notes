Matrix Partitioning: Large matrices are split along specific dimensions. For example, in a linear layer with shape [hidden_size, ffn_size], you might split along the ffn_size dimension.
Computational Flow:
Each device holds a portion of the weights
Input tensors are either replicated or split depending on the operation
Each device performs computation on its partition
Results are then synchronized through all-reduce or all-gather operations
this is what i was thinkin. haha, then u could run massive models on several smaller machines
which woudl be headski

Professional LLMs like Claude and other commercial services do implement sophisticated caching strategies, though the specifics vary between systems.
For large language model services, several levels of caching are common:
Common Caching Strategies in Production LLMs
1. KV-Cache (Attention Cache)
Almost all production LLM systems implement KV-caching for efficient autoregressive generation. This caches the key and value tensors for previous tokens during a single generation, avoiding redundant computation:

Standard practice: Claude, GPT-4, and all other commercial LLMs use this
Performance impact: 10-100x speedup for token generation after the first token

2. Request-Level Caching
Many commercial systems cache identical requests:

Implementation: Hash the exact prompt + parameters and store the result
TTL (Time-To-Live): Often short (minutes to hours) to balance staleness and performance
Used by: Many API services like OpenAI, Anthropic, and others for high-traffic patterns

3. Prompt Prefill Caching
A technique specifically for common prompt prefixes:

When many users share the same system prompt/instructions but have different user inputs
Cache the hidden states for common prefix portions
Claude likely uses this for its system instructions

4. Neuron/Layer Activation Caching
More sophisticated systems sometimes cache intermediate activations:

Less common than the above techniques
May be used for high-value, repeated computations
Requires more complex invalidation strategies

Considerations for Production Systems
Commercial systems like Claude balance several factors when implementing caching:

Memory constraints: GPU memory is expensive, so caches must be managed efficiently
Staleness: Models are updated regularly, so cache invalidation is crucial
Privacy: Ensures cached results don't leak between users
Determinism: Guarantees the same input gives the same output within a time window

Your Implementation vs. Commercial Systems
Your enhanced DistributedLLM implementation now includes KV-caching similar to production systems. Adding the query-level cache I suggested would make it more aligned with commercial offerings.
The approach of "tiered caching" (GPU → CPU → Disk) is also used in systems like Claude to maximize throughput while managing costs. This is particularly important when serving millions of users with limited GPU resources.
For a hobbyist or research system, your implementation with the enhancements represents a reasonable approximation of how commercial systems manage generation efficiency.
